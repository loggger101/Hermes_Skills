# Mental Models

Apply cognitive frameworks from several disciplines — systems, economics, psychology,
mathematics, strategy — to analyse problems, make decisions, and think more clearly.

Everything this skill needs is a file. No install, no dependencies, no tooling — you read
markdown.

## What This Skill Does

Applies a latticework of mental models — the 21 sourced ones bundled here, or your own files in Open Knowledge Format — to any problem. The agent reads `models/index.md`, checks for user-supplied model directories, selects 2-4 models from different areas (selection is reasoning, not keyword matching), walks each model's Thinking Steps against the actual facts, surfaces 'When to Avoid' conditions, and reports where models agree or disagree plus concrete next steps. Everything is plain markdown: no install, no dependencies.

## When to Use


- User names a specific model ("apply inversion", "use bottlenecks")
- User asks "help me think through X" or "what model fits X"
- User requests decision analysis, trade-off evaluation, or structured reasoning
- User describes a complex/ambiguous problem and wants a framework

## Step 1 — Load the index

Read [`models/index.md`](./models/index.md). It lists every bundled model with a one-line
description. It is short; load it in full.

Then check for the user's own models. The bundled set is a starting point, not a fixed list:

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `.mental-models/` (relative to the working directory) | this project's or team's models, committed with the code |
| a user-specified personal directory (upstream default `~/.claude/mental-models/`) | the user's personal models, available everywhere |

**Always run both globs before selecting. Do not assume they are empty** — one tool call
settles it, and a model the user wrote for exactly this situation is the most valuable thing
you can find. This matters most when the problem is urgent: urgency is precisely when a
team's own hard-won model is worth more than a general one, and precisely when you are
tempted to skip the check.

If either has files, read each one's YAML frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `tags`) to
learn what is there. A directory may have its own `index.md`; read that instead if present.
If both are empty, carry on with the bundled models.

**A user model always wins a name collision with a bundled one.** If someone wrote their own
`inversion.md`, they meant it — use theirs, and don't mention the built-in unless asked.

Treat user models as first-class. A model a team wrote about their own domain usually beats
a general one at that domain.

## Step 2 — YOU select the models

Read the user's problem and pick **2–4 models from different areas**. Selection is a
reasoning task and you are better at it than any keyword matcher: cross-area coverage is the
entire point of a *latticework* — a single-area pick means blind spots go unchecked.

**Discovery heuristics** to bias your reading of the index:

- **Risk / uncertainty / reversibility** → inversion, margin of safety, randomness
- **Stuck / can't see options** → first-principles thinking, second-order thinking, framing
- **Conflict / negotiation / competition** → bias from incentives, asymmetric warfare, trade-offs
- **Complex system / unintended effects** → feedback loops, emergence, bottlenecks, leverage
- **Performance / optimization** → bottlenecks, leverage, activation energy
- **People / team / behaviour** → bias from incentives, social proof, confirmation bias
- **Evaluating evidence or results** → sampling, regression to the mean, randomness
- **Change that won't start, or won't stop** → activation energy, inertia

## Step 3 — Retrieve each pick

Read the file directly. Bundled models are flat files named by slug:

```
models/<slug>.md
```

e.g. `models/inversion.md`. The index gives you the exact filename — use it rather than
guessing. User models are at the path you found them.

## Step 4 — Apply

Each model file has YAML frontmatter and four parts:

- the **description prose** — what the idea is and where it comes from, with `[^footnotes]`
  pointing at entries in the frontmatter's `sources`
- **When to Avoid** — read this *before* concluding, and surface it if it applies. It is what
  separates a mental model from a slogan.
- **Thinking Steps** — walk these against the user's actual facts. Follow them; don't
  paraphrase the framework away.
- **Coaching Questions** — ask these to deepen the analysis where useful.

Show where the chosen models agree, and where they disagree.

## Step 5 — Report

- Name which models you used and why you picked them
- Where models disagreed, say so explicitly rather than silently picking a winner
- End with 3–5 concrete, actionable next steps
- Name any "when to avoid" conditions that apply to this case
- If a source matters to the point you are making, cite it — the `sources` block has the link

## Core Guidelines

1. **2–4 models per analysis, from different areas** — coverage over quantity
2. **Follow the Thinking Steps verbatim** — don't paraphrase the framework away
3. **Always check When to Avoid** — warn the user if the model misfits
4. **Latticework**: show how chosen models connect and where they disagree
5. **Be actionable**: end with concrete next steps, not theory
6. **Name biases honestly**: if the user seems caught in one, surface it

## The format

`models/` is an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format)
bundle: a directory of markdown files, each with YAML frontmatter carrying at minimum a
`type`. That means any OKF bundle can be dropped into `.mental-models/` and read the same way,
and this bundle can be consumed by any OKF-aware agent.

Obsidian vaults work too — treat `[[wikilink]]` as a link to `wikilink.md`.

To write your own, copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md).

## Files in This Skill

- `SKILL.md` — this entry point
- `TEMPLATE.md` — the format; copy it to write your own model
- `models/` — the bundled OKF bundle: `index.md` plus one file per model

Outside this skill, and never overwritten by an update:

- `.mental-models/*.md` — the working directory's own models
- `~/.claude/mental-models/*.md` — the user's personal models
